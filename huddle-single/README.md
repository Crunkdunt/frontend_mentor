## Overview

I stripped my design back by using pure css on this challenge. Doing so has further cemented my basic understanding of css terminology to follow into sass.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned
I really understood the use of flex grow, shrink and basis during this challenge.

Understanding that a flex basis of 100% would essentially block an entire flex row/column was a game changer for me.

Mobile first design has been getting far easier as the challenges continue.

### Continued development

I would like to further expand my understanding of flexbox sizings wuth basis, grow, shrink etc. I also want to start bringing grid into the overall page layout
