## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

I started this design by making note of the variables within the Figma file. After setting variables for the fonts, colours etc, I started to layout the html. 
The html itself is not semantic, i opted for simplicity for the sake of practice. 
I will revisit this again in the future to update and refactor.

SCSS was used for the CSS, this allowed me to create mixins for the font and breakpoints, among other things.   

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- SASS/SCSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM - a first attempt. Not 100% but good practice

### What I learned

Doing this allowed me to gain a firmer grasp and appreciation of the simplicity of flex for layouts and sturcture. I am happy with how close to the design brief my solution is. I also learned that it is easy to fall into a padding and margin hellscape, so its best to try to avoid.

This project has also greatly helped my appreciation of SCSS and BEM.


### Continued development

I am looking forward to working through more of the frontend mentor challenges.
