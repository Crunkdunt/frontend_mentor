## Overview
This was a frustrating challenge. I have agonsed over the layout and confused myself for hours with the modification of flex and grid, but it has been valuable. I am overall satisfied with this result but would like to come back to it when my skills and knowledge expands.
### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process
I started by trying to frame the site with grid and using flexbox for the hero and the cards. Orginally i wanted to use flex for the footer, but i opted for grid.

The footer was insanely annoying and i found myself unable to split the footer nav over two columns in full desktop view.

I am not overly happy with the transition between mobile to desktop, espeically with the hero image sizing, but i need to move on.
### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS
- BEM



### What I learned

I have become more comfortable using flex and grid for layout and structure. Im eager to move onto different challenges. 


### Continued development
 Moving forward i will continue with the playinhg with Grid. I need to wrap my head around the layout quicker. I need to learn how to usilise the grid-template-columns, rows etc, along with auto flow.
